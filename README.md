## Trippy Trips is an Android app for travel planning that uses Google Places API to search for hotels, restaurants, and activities for a given search query. Users can also perform a quick search for their current locations. Not only that, users can also add their favorite places, which are stored using a SQLite database. Finally, the app is developed to be secure for users using the PBKDF2WithHmacSha1 hashing algorithm for passwords.
